The data was cataloged on 29/11/2024, as indicated in the link description.

# This new dataset features columns with improved names and formatting. Additionally, detailed metadata is available in an Excel file named #"descricao_campos", located in the directory A:\propertyRights\protec_Areas\rawData\2024-10.

# Compared to the previous version, this new dataset contains 1,027 additional observations, 193 of which were imported from a specialized shapefile named # shp_cnuc_2024_10_pt. As the name suggests, the geometries in this shapefile are points, which are suspected to represent the centroids of the respective # UC areas (this still needs verification).

# The other shapefile, shp_cnuc_2024_10_pol.shp, retains the same general structure as the previous version, but with improved column names and #formatting, as previously mentioned, and now it has the CRS.
