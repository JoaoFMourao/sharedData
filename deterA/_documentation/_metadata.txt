# obs: manual edits to input directory
#   > JUL/2010 data duplicated in original source (under names 'nuvem' and 'nuvens') -- excluded folder named 'nuvem' for consistency with other 2010 cloud directories
#   > changed layer names for MAR/2009 and MAR/2010 from MAR¢O to MARCO
#   > corrected typo in NOV/2008 folder name -- originally named 2009, but in 2008 online data repository
#   > corrected typo in DEC/2012 folder name -- _sjp (instead of _shp) in online data repository
#   > corrected capitalization mismatch across dbf/shp/shx file names for alert layers (several occurrences throughout)
#   > manually deleted "surplus" downladed data: (i) spr and tif files in 2004/2005 and (ii) extra layers in SEP/2011 alert 
#   > manually corrected layer name for JAN/2016 from "props" to "pol"

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOWNLOAD (MANUALLY BUT IT IS POSSIBLE TO AUTOMATIZE)
# 1) insert the url "http://www1.dpi.inpe.br/obt/deter/dados/" on the browser
# 2) for each folder with pattern "YYYY" from 2004 through 2016:
#	2.0) create the same "YYYY" folder pattern inside "data\raw2clean\land_cover\deter_inpe\input" 
# 	2.1) enter in the folder
#	2.2) download each zip file with pattern "Deter_YYYYMM_shp.zip" and "Nuvem_YYYYMM_shp.zip" (or "Nuvens_YYYYMM_shp.zip")
#	2.3) unzip each downloaded folder
# 3) follow the instructions above for manual edits to input directory
