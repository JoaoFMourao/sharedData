# STEPS USED TO OBTAIN THE DATA:
# 1) Contacted Imazon asking for access
# 2) Received the link for the data asset in GEE (https://code.earthengine.google.com/?asset=projects/imazon-simex/FLORESER/floreser-collection-50-6-ages)
# 3) Used the following script to export the data https://code.earthengine.google.com/64a3c655d670a4da6eb2f22c3ffd0106 (GEE aumatomatically splits large rasters into smaller pieces, in this case each year is splitted in 12 pieces)
