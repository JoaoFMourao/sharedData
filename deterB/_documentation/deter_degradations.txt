Description:

This database contains the cumulated history of Deter B degradation alerts starting on August 2020.
As opposed to the publicly available data in TerraBrasilis, these degradation alerts are not reclassified to Clear Cut Deforestation alerts if degradation converst to deforestation.
This allows us to trace the history of all degradation alerts for a given area, regardless of whether it is converted to deforestation or not.
