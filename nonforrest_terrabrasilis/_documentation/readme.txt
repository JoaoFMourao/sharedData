b)Content
- This dataset, cut out by the boundaries of the Amazon biome(), shows the areas with vegetation typologies that 
  do not fall into the Forest class adopted in the mapping, which consequently are not the object of analysis and 
  mapping by the project.

- The list of attributes is standardized with deforestation data, PRODES' main class. The other classes are filled 
in only when applicable.
