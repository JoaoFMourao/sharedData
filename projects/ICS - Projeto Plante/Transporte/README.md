# ICS - Projeto Plante - Transporte

**Status:** In progress

## Purpose

This folder hosts the transport-sector analysis for Projeto Plante, including notebooks, scripts, and outputs.

## Layout

```
Transporte/
|-- README.md
|-- notebooks/
|-- src/
|   |-- figures/          # R scripts for figure generation
|-- results/
|-- reports/
```

## Usage notes

- The R scripts currently use absolute input/output paths (e.g., OneDrive). Update them to local paths before running.
- Store generated outputs under `results/` (create `figures/` and `tables/` subfolders as needed).
