### CODE ###
#
# In "A:\propertyRights\CAR_Geoserver\code" you will find 3 code files. They are: 
#
# 1) 01_r2c_car_geoserver.Rdata
#
#	- This code is a first cleaning proccess of the raw data, in which all the data is downloaded in a repository for each state and there is a small cleaning as well.
#
#
# 2) 02_car_muni.Rdata
# 
# 
# 	- This code loads the SICAR clean data and does the intersection with municipalities` boundries. This include: 
#             - Crossing with municipalities 
#              - Adjust CRS 
#             - Organize final data in municipality-chunck data 

# 3) 03_add_biome_info_sicar.Rdata
#
#  	- This code crosses the previous base (from step 2) with biome boundaries. 
#       - it also calculates the % of each CAR that is in each biome 
#       - Finally, the code drops the geometry of the base and puts all the information in one single base (that's going to be merged later on in another code from the car-
#         car project) 
# 
#
#
#### DATA #### 
# 
## RAW_DATA ## 
#  
#     - Sicar data just as download divided in big chuncks
# 
## CLEAN_DATA ## 
#     - SICAR base after download and basic cleaning, divided in big chuncks
#
## BUILT_MUNI ## 
##
#      - Clean Sicar base crossed with municipalities and paralelized for municipality-chunck
# 
#          - Inside this directory, there's a directory called "car_biome" 
#                - The data in this directory is the same as the data described just above, but it has biome information for each CAR. 
#                - So this base represents the clean Sicar base crossed with municipalities and with biomes.
