### CODE ###
#
# In "A:\land\prodes_CaatingaBiome\code" you will find 3 code files. They are: 
#
# 1) 01_r2c_lcv_dfrst_caat_biome_prodes_inpe_sf.Rdata
#
#	- This code is a first cleaning proccess to the raw data, in which we: 
# 		- Change variables names 
# 		- Check and put every variable in its ideal class 
# 		- Clean special characters 
#
# 2) 02_mrg_withCaatingaMuni.Rdata
# 
# 
# 	- This code loads the Prodes clean data and crosses it with municipalities baundaries and paralelizes it for # 	each municipality 

# 3) 03_crossCheck.Rdata
#
#  	- This code checks if the deforestation rates generated from the previous code matches with the reported 
# 	deforestation rates by Prodes. 
# 
# 	OBS: Since we use a different CRS compared to the one used to calculate the reported deforestation rates, 
# 	it is expected some degree of difference between the rates. You can check the results in: 
# 	"A:\land\prodes_CaatingaBiome\cleanData\03_crossCheck.xlsx"
